spring.application.name: my-application

# The code will automatically pick up properties under:
#   <prefix>/<name>/*
#   <prefix>/<default-context>/* 
# ...where the former values override the latter.
# It's not really practical to override these values externally, so what you set here goes.

aws.paramstore:
  name: my-demo             # The default is whatever is in spring.application.name
  prefix: /properties	      # The default is "/config".  So anything under <prefix>/<name>/* will get picked up.
  default-context: default	# The default is "application".  <prefix>/<default-context>/* will get picked up.
